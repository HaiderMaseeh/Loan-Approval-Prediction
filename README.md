# Loan Approval Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts loan approval status based on historical data. The project is designed to help financial institutions automate the loan approval process by analyzing key features of applicants and loans.

## Project Overview
In this notebook, I develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved. The dataset consists of multiple features such as:

Person Age
Person Income
Person Home Ownership
Person Employment Length
Loan Intent
Loan Grade
Loan Amount
Loan Interest Rate
Loan Percent Income
Credit History Length
Loan Status (Target variable)

## Key Steps

### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and categorical variables.
Label Encoding of categorical data.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Feature Engineering:
Exploration and transformation of features to improve model accuracy.

### Model Building:
Random Forest Classifier: A robust ensemble model used to predict loan status.
Cross-Validation: To validate model performance.

### Libraries Used
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
sklearn for machine learning algorithms
